# Eco-Tourism Management Portal for Karnataka

A FastAPI web application for discovering Karnataka destinations, planning trip
budgets, booking tourism services, and managing visitor feedback. It also
provides authorized staff with a data-entry page for aggregate environmental
observations. The interface uses server-rendered Jinja2 templates and a
responsive, nature-inspired CSS design.

## Features

### Visitor accounts

- Register as a visitor, sign in, and sign out.
- Passwords are stored as bcrypt hashes; authentication uses a JWT in an
  HTTP-only cookie.
- View and update profile name and phone number, and change the account
  password.
- Access a personal dashboard with bookings, saved destinations, and reviews.

### Destination discovery and management

- Browse approved destinations and search by name, location, district, or
  description.
- Filter the destination list by category and district.
- View destination details including location, description, entry fee, visiting
  hours, best season, eco rating, map coordinates (when supplied), reviews,
  stays, guides, and activities.
- Signed-in users can submit destination suggestions. Suggestions from
  non-admin users remain pending until reviewed.
- Admins can approve, reject, or delete destinations.
- Signed-in visitors can save approved destinations to their wishlist.

### Stays, guides, activities, and bookings

- Browse available stays, local guides, and destination activities.
- Place authenticated bookings for a stay, guide, or activity.
- Booking prices are calculated on the server from the selected service and
  booking dates, guest count, or room count; submitted totals are not trusted.
- Booking validation checks dates, destination and service association,
  availability, room quantity, and activity group limits.
- View personal bookings and cancel bookings. Admins can cancel any booking.
- Each booking receives a unique reference code and starts with pending status.
- No payment processing or live inventory integration is currently provided.

### Reviews and complaints

- Signed-in visitors can submit destination reviews with a star rating, title,
  and comment.
- Browse recent reviews and filter them by rating.
- A reviewer can delete their own review; admins can delete any review.
- Signed-in visitors can submit complaints and view their own complaint history.
- Admins can view all complaints, post a response, and resolve a complaint.

### Budget planning

- Estimate trip expenses for accommodation, entry fees, food, transport, guides,
  activities, and other costs.
- View a live-updating total in the browser.
- Signed-in users can save budget plans and view their saved plans.

### EcoGuide AI Travel Assistant (Powered by Google Gemini)

- Conversational AI travel assistant specialized in Karnataka eco-tourism.
- Recommends wildlife sanctuaries, hidden waterfalls, eco-homestays, trekking trails, and local cuisine.
- Supports multi-language guidance (English, Kannada, Hindi).
- Interactive chat UI at `/ai-guide` with quick prompt suggestions and markdown-formatted travel itineraries.
- REST API endpoint at `POST /ai-guide/chat` with configurable model support (`gemini-2.5-flash`, `gemini-1.5-flash`, etc.).


### Environmental observations (admin only)

- Authorized admins can submit destination-linked observations with a timestamp
  and optional trail or zone.
- Available fields cover aggregate visitor activity, waste generation and
  collection, water use and availability, transport, environmental conditions,
  wildlife observations or disturbance reports, and local participation and
  revenue.
- Each observation is labeled as measured, estimated, or mixed. Numeric ranges
  and required fields are validated before saving.
- Admins can browse up to 100 recent records and filter the history by
  destination.
- Records are aggregate; the form is not intended to collect visitor names or
  contact information.
- These observations support research and are not validated ecological
  standards, automated access decisions, or proof of causal relationships.

### Interface, backgrounds, and accessibility

- Responsive pages for the home page, destinations, destination details,
  registration and login, profile, dashboard, reviews, bookings, stays, guides,
  activities, complaints, budget planning, and environmental monitoring.
- A responsive, editorial visual design with a local-media-ready landscape
  hero, category navigation, destination cards, and consistent forms and
  tables.
- A sticky translucent header that becomes a light frosted bar while scrolling,
  plus an accessible small-screen navigation menu.
- A Scene picker for Auto, Sunrise, Day, Rain, Waterfall, and Sunset. A manual
  choice is stored in browser local storage; Auto follows the visitor's local
  time. A pause/play control is available on immersive pages.
- Respect for reduced-motion preferences, visible keyboard focus, a
  skip-to-content link, descriptive image alternatives, and lazy loading for
  destination images.
- Remote Google Fonts are optional enhancements; system font fallbacks are
  defined. Background photos and videos are not hotlinked.

## Roles

| Role | Capabilities |
| --- | --- |
| Visitor | Browse destinations; maintain a profile; save places; book services; create budget plans; submit reviews and complaints. |
| Guide | Uses the account and booking features available to signed-in users; guide listings can be shown for destinations. |
| Admin | Visitor capabilities plus destination moderation, complaint responses, and environmental observation entry and history. |

## Technology

- **Backend:** FastAPI
- **Database and models:** SQLModel with SQLite by default
- **Templates:** Jinja2 server-rendered HTML
- **Frontend:** Plain modular CSS and vanilla JavaScript
- **Authentication:** HTTP-only JWT cookie and bcrypt password hashing
- **Tests:** pytest with FastAPI `TestClient`

## Quick start

Requirements: Python and pip.

1. From the project root, create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```powershell
   py -m venv .venv
   .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```

   On macOS or Linux:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. Set a unique, high-entropy `SECRET_KEY` before
   using the application beyond local development. The default database URL
   uses SQLite:

   ```dotenv
   DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./eco_tourism.db
   SECRET_KEY=replace-with-a-long-random-secret
   ALGORITHM=HS256
   APP_NAME=Eco Tourism Management Portal
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

5. Open <http://127.0.0.1:8000>.

On startup, the application creates its database tables and inserts demo data
if the seeded admin account is not already present.

## Demo accounts

These credentials are intended only for a local demo. Change or remove seeded
accounts and use a secure `SECRET_KEY` before deploying the application.

| Role | Email | Password |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Admin | `admin@ecotourism.in` | `admin123` |
| Visitor | `visitor@ecotourism.in` | `visitor123` |
| Guide | `guide@ecotourism.in` | `guide123` |

```

## Running tests

From the project root:

```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_smoke.py -q
```

The smoke tests exercise the core rendered pages and workflows, including
registration and login, booking price calculation and validation, admin
complaint responses, environmental observation entry and history, and static
asset delivery.

## Frontend media and credits

The interface references local files under `app/static/media/` and
`app/static/images/places/`. **No stock video or photograph files are currently
bundled.** The design therefore uses its CSS landscape gradients until you add
rights-verified local images and videos. This avoids fake credits, broken
hotlinks, and unverified image licensing.

The Scene picker supports these local video basenames:

- `hero-sunrise-mountains`
- `hero-day-clouds`
- `hero-rain-forest`
- `hero-waterfall`
- `hero-sunset-hills`

For each basename, add `.mp4` (H.264), `.webm` (VP9/AV1), and a matching `.jpg`
poster to `app/static/media/`. Optional mobile encodes use `-mobile.mp4` and
`-mobile.webm`. The app selects smaller mobile files when available and uses
the local poster/gradient when videos cannot be played. See
[app/static/media/README.md](./app/static/media/README.md) for the subjects,
format and optimization requirements.

Add destination files as
`app/static/images/places/<lowercase-name-with-hyphens>.jpg`. Missing photos
fall back to a designed landscape treatment. Keep a creator, source URL,
licence/terms, and download date for every installed stock asset in
[app/static/media/CREDITS.md](./app/static/media/CREDITS.md) and
`app/static/images/places/CREDITS.md`.

The public credits document is available at
[/static/media/credits.html](http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/media/credits.html).
It is served as a static asset so the backend route table remains unchanged.
The stock-media source pages must be checked for the specific asset and current
licence before download; see the credit instructions for the Pexels licence
overview. Video autoplay is skipped for reduced-motion preferences, data
saver, and slow connections. Background clips pause when hidden or when the
home hero scrolls out of view.

## Current scope and limitations

- The seeded catalogue currently contains three example destinations; the
  broader 16-destination catalogue and destination-specific locally licensed
  photography described in the design brief have not been added yet. Existing
  sample entry fees and eco ratings are demo data, not official current tariffs
  or government certifications.
- The Scene picker and media-loading behavior are implemented, but the visual
  loop/cross-fade can only be verified once local video encodes are supplied.
- The `/credits` application route is not added because this frontend/media
  task keeps the FastAPI route table unchanged. Use the static credits page
  linked in the footer for now.
- Environmental collection and history are implemented; sustainability
  dashboards, a calculated Environmental Pressure Index, analytics reports,
  carrying-capacity assessments, and machine-learning predictions are not
  implemented yet.
- The database is initialized with `create_all`; there is no migration system
  for modifying existing tables.
- This project is a functional development/demo portal, not an integrated
  government service. Production deployment would require additional security,
  privacy, operational, accessibility, and data-governance review.
